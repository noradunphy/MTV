# MCQ Optimization Guide for Base Models (Llama-3.1-8B)

This guide explains how to optimize multiple choice question (MCQ) prompts for non-instruction-tuned models like Llama-3.1-8B to achieve better performance with MTV.

## Key Principles for Base Models

### 1. **Direct and Concise Format**
Base models work best with direct, task-specific prompts rather than verbose instructions.

**❌ Bad (Instruction-tuned style):**
```
Chat 1
A: How are you doing today?
B: I'm doing well, thanks.
Options:
A. Thank you for telling me.
B. I need help with my homework.
C. Me too, it's my favorite food.
D. That's great to hear!
Final Response A: D
______
```

**✅ Good (Base model optimized):**
```
Context: A: How are you doing today?
B: I'm doing well, thanks.
Options: A.Thank you for telling me. B.I need help with my homework. C.Me too, it's my favorite food. D.That's great to hear!
Answer: D
```

### 2. **Consistent Pattern Recognition**
Base models rely heavily on pattern recognition. Use consistent formatting across all examples.

### 3. **Minimal Token Overhead**
Reduce unnecessary tokens to focus the model's attention on the task.

## Optimized Format Structure

### Few-Shot Examples
```
Context: [dialogue context]
Options: A.[option1] B.[option2] C.[option3] D.[option4]
Answer: [letter]

Context: [dialogue context]
Options: A.[option1] B.[option2] C.[option3] D.[option4]
Answer: [letter]

[blank line for separation]
```

### Query Format
```
Context: [dialogue context]
Options: A.[option1] B.[option2] C.[option3] D.[option4]
Answer:
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Context Formatting**
- Use "Context:" prefix for dialogue history
- Keep context concise but informative
- Remove unnecessary formatting like "Chat 1", "______"

### 2. **Options Formatting**
- Use inline format: `A.[option] B.[option] C.[option] D.[option]`
- No line breaks between options
- Consistent spacing and punctuation

### 3. **Answer Formatting**
- Use "Answer:" prefix (not "Final Response")
- Single letter response
- No additional text or formatting

### 4. **Example Separation**
- Use blank lines between examples
- Consistent spacing throughout

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Instruction-tuned style):
```
Chat 1
A: How are you doing today?
B: I'm doing well, thanks.
Options:
A. Thank you for telling me.
B. I need help with my homework.
C. Me too, it's my favorite food.
D. That's great to hear!
Final Response A: D
______

A: What do you think about the weather?
B: It's quite nice today.
Options:
A. I agree, it's beautiful outside.
B. Can you help me with this?
C. That's interesting.
D. I don't know.
Final Response A:
```

**Token count: ~150 tokens**

### After (Base model optimized):
```
Context: A: How are you doing today?
B: I'm doing well, thanks.
Options: A.Thank you for telling me. B.I need help with my homework. C.Me too, it's my favorite food. D.That's great to hear!
Answer: D

Context: A: What do you think about the weather?
B: It's quite nice today.
Options: A.I agree, it's beautiful outside. B.Can you help me with this? C.That's interesting. D.I don't know.
Answer:
```

**Token count: ~80 tokens (47% reduction)**

## Performance Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Token Usage**
- 40-50% fewer tokens per example
- More examples can fit in context window
- Faster inference times

### 2. **Better Pattern Recognition**
- Consistent format across all examples
- Clear input-output mapping
- Reduced cognitive load on the model

### 3. **Improved Accuracy**
- Direct task focus without instruction overhead
- Consistent response format
- Better few-shot learning

## Best Practices

### 1. **Option Ordering**
- Randomize option positions to prevent position bias
- Ensure correct answer appears in different positions across examples

### 2. **Distractor Quality**
- Use realistic distractors from the dataset
- Avoid generic responses like "I don't know"
- Maintain similar length and style to correct answers

### 3. **Context Length**
- Keep context concise but complete
- Include essential dialogue history
- Remove redundant information

### 4. **Few-Shot Examples**
- Use 2-4 examples for optimal performance
- Ensure examples cover different dialogue acts
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Testing the Optimization

### Run the test script:
```bash
python3 test_multiple_choice.py
```

### Expected output format:
```
Context: A: How are you doing today?
B: I'm doing well, thanks.
Options: A.Thank you for telling me. B.I need help with my homework. C.Me too, it's my favorite food. D.That's great to hear!
Answer: D

Context: A: What do you think about the weather?
B: It's quite nice today.
Options: A.I agree, it's beautiful outside. B.Can you help me with this? C.That's interesting. D.I don't know.
Answer:
```

## Usage with MTV

The optimized format is now the default for SWDA in the MTV pipeline:

```bash
python mtv_eval.py --model_name text --data_name swda \
  --train_path data/swda/processed/train.json \
  --val_path data/swda/processed/val.json \
  --num_example 100 --num_shot 4 --eval_num_shot 2 \
  --max_token 5 --cur_mode both \
  --bernoullis_path storage/swda_bernoullis.pt \
  --activation_path storage/swda_activations.pt
```

## Additional Optimizations

### 1. **Temperature and Sampling**
- Use lower temperature (0.1-0.3) for more consistent letter prediction
- Consider greedy decoding for single-token responses

### 2. **Context Window Management**
- Monitor token usage to stay within model limits
- Adjust few-shot examples based on context length

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Focus on letter accuracy rather than full utterance generation
- Track position bias in option selection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Model generates full words instead of letters**
   - Ensure consistent "Answer:" format in examples
   - Use lower temperature for more deterministic output

2. **Position bias in option selection**
   - Randomize option positions more thoroughly
   - Balance examples across different positions

3. **Poor few-shot performance**
   - Reduce number of few-shot examples
   - Ensure examples are from same dialogue act
   - Simplify context if too verbose

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic formatting**: Adjust format based on model size and capabilities
2. **Semantic distractors**: Use similarity-based distractor selection
3. **Context optimization**: Implement context truncation strategies
4. **Multi-turn dialogue**: Extend format for longer conversation contexts
